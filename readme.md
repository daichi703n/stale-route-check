## NOTE: This Script is an alpha version, please use it at your own risk.

This is a simple script to check whether there are stale routes in PCF/gorouter.

For details of the original bug, please check this [link](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2245594/stories/165730393)

Make sure you put all necessary env variables in check_routes.sh and compare.py, then run check_routes.sh, the output should tell you whether there is any stale routes currently in gorouter.
